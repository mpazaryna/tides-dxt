Analyze tide data and productivity patterns from the stored tides.

Analysis focus: $ARGUMENTS

Follow these steps:

1. Load tide data from storage (`~/.config/tides-dxt/tides.json`)
2. Parse and analyze tide patterns based on requested focus:
   - If "weekly": Analyze weekly productivity patterns
   - If "daily": Analyze daily flow intensities and completion rates
   - If "project": Focus on project-type tides and their outcomes
   - If "insights": Extract patterns from captured insights
   - If no specific focus: Provide comprehensive overview
3. Generate visualizations or summaries of patterns
4. Identify productivity trends and recommendations
5. Suggest optimizations for future tide planning

Analysis areas:
- Flow intensity preferences and success rates
- Time-of-day productivity patterns
- Tide completion rates by type
- Insight themes and learnings
- Seasonal productivity variations
